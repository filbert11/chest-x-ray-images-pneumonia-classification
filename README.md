# Chest X-ray Images Pneumonia Classification

## Objectives
The aim of this project is to detect the pneumonia from chext x-ray result by using machine learning model (convolutional neural network)

## Dataset
The dataset of this project is taken from https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/rscbjbr9sj/2 by:
Kermany, Daniel; Zhang, Kang; Goldbaum, Michael (2018), “Labeled Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and Chest X-Ray Images for Classification”, Mendeley Data, V2, doi: 10.17632/rscbjbr9sj.2

## Executive Summary
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Pre-processing of Data
2. Training of Machine learning models

## Conclusion
The dataset is pretty imbalance with more normal classes.
The convolutional neural network performs well with f1 macro of 0.85.

The model can be improved further with more dataset from normal classes.
